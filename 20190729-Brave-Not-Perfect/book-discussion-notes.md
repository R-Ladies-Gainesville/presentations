Information sent to R-Ladies Gainesville
Join us for a book club discussion of Reshma Saujani’s Brave, Not Perfect. Reshma is the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code. 
In her popular [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/reshma_saujani_teach_girls_bravery_not_perfection?language=en), 
she advocates for girls to learn coding as a way to practice failure and overcome expectations of “perfection”. 
Her book Brave, Not Perfect expands on these ideas by describing how society promotes perfection, 
why we should be learning to be brave instead, and how to achieve this goal. 

### Limitations
1. Binary gender terminology
2. Downsides to taking risks?

### Women in tech
1. Reshma's book and talks present the hypothesis that women are underrepresented in the tech industry because they are encouraged
to be perfect, which is a limitation to success in an industry where taking risks is necessary. Do you agree with this hypothesis?
Would you phrase it differently?
2. What other fields require risk-taking? Is the tech industry unique in this or other ways?
3. What aspects of being an R user do you find intimidating?

### Perfection
1. How does the goal of perfection operate as a barrier in your life?
2. Are there ways that you reinforce expectations of perfection in your career or personal life and how could you change those?
3. How can we distinguish between striving for perfection and striving for excellence?

### Practicing Bravery
1. Coding is a great tool for practicing failure. What are some other tools you currently or could use? 
2. What were some suggestions from the book for practiciting bravery that you liked?
3. What are some good examples of bravery that you’ve seen in your field or career?
